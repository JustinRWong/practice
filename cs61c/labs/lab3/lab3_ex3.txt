1. what do the .data, .word, .text directives mean?
.data means data segment, .text means beginning code segment. .word means to allocate space and store data whose size is word.

2. Find the Text Segment in the Execute tab, What happened to the pesudo-instruction la(line 9).
load address of n to register t3

3. How do you set a breakpoint in MARS? Set a breakpoint on line 14 and run to it. What is the instruction address? Has line 14 executed yet?
First: "Run"->"Assemble" 
Second: In "Execute" tab, select the checkbox before the target instruction.
Third: run "Run" -> "Go"
The instruction address is 0x00400020
Now line 14 has not beeen  executed.

4. Once at a breakpoint, how do you continue to execute your code? How do you step through your code? Run the code to completion.
I can use "Step" to step through code, or else "go" to run to completion.

5. Find the "Run I/O" window. What number did the program ouput? Which fib number is this?
The output number is 34. 34 is the 9th fibonicci number.
fibonacci series:0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
index            0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8  9


6. At what address is n stored in memory? Try finding this by(1)looking at the Data Segment and (2) looking at the machine code.
By looking at the Data Segment, the address of n is 0x10010010
By looking at the machine code, the address is 0x0010

7.Without using the "Edit" tab, have the program calculate the 13th fib number by manually modify this memory location before execution.
Yes, we can set breakpoint on line 3, and run to this line, then modify the value to 0x0000000d, then run to completion, we can get  233

8. How do you view and modify the contents of a register? Reset the simulation(Run -> Reset or F12) and now calculate the 13th fib number by (1)breaking at a well-chosen spot, (2) modifying a single register, and then (3)unsetting the breakpoint.
Set breakpoint on line 11, then change register t3 to 0x0000000d, then cancel the breakpoint and run to completion, then we can get 233.

9.Lines 19 and 21 ue the syscall instruction. What is it and how do you use it?
Follow the help menu.In line 19, the code in $v0 is 1, then it is used to print an integer. In line 21, the code in $v0 is 10, then it is used to terminate the program.
